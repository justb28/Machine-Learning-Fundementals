# Machine Learning Fundamentals – From Scratch Implementation

This repository contains solutions to a Machine Learning assignment focused on implementing core ML algorithms **from first principles**, without using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

The objective of the assignment was to understand the mathematical foundations behind machine learning models by coding them manually in Python.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The project covers fundamental machine learning concepts, including:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Cost Functions
- Model Evaluation Metrics
- Basic Data Preprocessing

All algorithms were implemented manually using only basic Python and numerical tools (e.g., NumPy for matrix operations).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the mathematical derivation of core ML algorithms.
- Implement optimization techniques such as gradient descent.
- Manually compute loss functions and parameter updates.
- Evaluate model performance without relying on pre-built ML utilities.

This assignment emphasizes conceptual clarity and algorithmic understanding rather than production-ready efficiency.
